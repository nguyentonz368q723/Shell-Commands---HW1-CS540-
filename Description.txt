This application creates a simple menu-driven command line interface for performing fundamental file system tasks in Windows.

Here are the major points:


- It offers the user with a selection of six possibilities and repeatedly asks them to select one until they choose to depart.
Option 1 uses the dir command to list the contents of a directory.
- Option 2 uses the cd command to display the current working directory.
- Option 3 creates and then deletes the directory cs540-hw1.
- Option 4 uses the echo command to produce a greeting message.
- Option 5 uses the type command to concatenate text files and create a merged_file.
- It is written in C++, although the majority of the work is accomplished by invoking Windows system commands.
- There is some rudimentary error handling; for example, if creating/deleting directories or concatenating fails, errors are shown.
- The comments at the top suggest that this is homework 1 for a CS-540 class by a student called Nguyen Huu Tam Ton.
To summarize, it allows you to explore some fundamental file system functions by invoking CLI commands from a C++ application using a simple menu interface.
